The sql scripts in the below is for creating table and seeding data for orleans clustering, persistence and remiander. 
It will create the following tables:
1. OrleansQuery
2. OrleansMembershipTable
3. OrleansMembershipVersionTable
4. OrleansRemindersTable
5. Storage

Please copy and run it in your SqlServer database !
